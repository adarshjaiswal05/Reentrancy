# Reentrancy Contract with Event Listener

This repository contains a simple Ethereum smart contract designed to demonstrate an event listener for the "Deposite" event. Additionally, it includes a script (`server.js`) that interacts with the contract through an Ethereum provider.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

- Node.js installed
- An Ethereum wallet with testnet (Mumbai) funds
- Alchemy API key (for Ethereum provider)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   cd your-repository
   
const contractAddress = 'YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS';
const alchemyAPIKey = 'YOUR_ALCHEMY_API_KEY';
const provider = new ethers.providers.WebSocketProvider(`https://polygon-mumbai.g.alchemy.com/v2/${alchemyAPIKey}`);
const contract = new ethers.Contract(contractAddress, ABI, provider);

Running the Script
Run the script using the following command:
node server.js

Remember to replace the placeholder values such as `YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` and `YOUR_ALCHEMY_API_KEY` with your actual contract address and Alchemy API key. Additionally, make sure to include the necessary details about your contract, dependencies, and how to run the script in the README.
